## 1. Experiment Objectives

1. **Multi-Model Parallelization**: Implement a uniform $4000 \times 4000$ matrix multiplication workload across four fundamental parallel paradigms: Sequential, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA.
2. **Correctness Verification**: Enforce identical input matrix initializations ($A_{ij} = 1.0, B_{ij} = 1.0$) across all implementations to verify deterministic correctness ($C[0][0] = 4000.00$).
3. **Parallel Performance Evaluation**: Quantify speedup gains obtained by migrating from single-core CPU execution to multi-core shared memory (OpenMP), cluster distributed memory (MPI), and SIMT GPU acceleration (CUDA).
4. **Overhead Analysis**: Analyze communication latency in network-bound MPI clusters and host-to-device memory transfer overheads ($H2D$ / $D2H$) in CUDA.

### Architectural Breakdown

#### 1. Sequential CPU Execution
Execution follows a traditional single-threaded, triple-nested loop ($O(N^3)$ complexity). Instructions run strictly sequentially on a single CPU core without hardware concurrency.

#### 2. OpenMP (Shared Memory)
OpenMP uses compiler directives (`#pragma omp parallel for`) to fork 8 worker threads sharing a single unified memory address space. Loop iterations are dynamically divided across CPU cores.

#### 3. MPI (Distributed Memory)
MPI operates across disjoint memory address spaces over a virtual network connecting 4 Ubuntu VMs (`master`, `worker1`, `worker2`, `worker3`). 
- **Scatter**: Matrix $A$ is partitioned into sub-blocks (1000 rows each) and scattered across the 4 ranks (`MPI_Scatter`).
- **Broadcast**: Matrix $B$ is duplicated to all ranks (`MPI_Bcast`).
- **Gather**: Computed partial results are assembled back into Matrix $C$ on Rank 0 (`MPI_Gather`).

#### 4. CUDA (Massively Parallel SIMT)
CUDA offloads computation from host CPU memory to device GPU memory via PCIe bus. The computation is structured into a 2D execution grid:
- **Grid Configuration**: $250 \times 250 = 62,500$ blocks
- **Block Configuration**: $16 \times 16 = 256$ threads/block
- **Total Logical GPU Threads**: $16,000,000$ threads running concurrently.

---

## 3. Workload Specification

- **Matrix Dimension ($N$)**: $4000 \times 4000$
- **Input Matrix $A$**: $A[i][j] = 1.0$ for all $i, j$
- **Input Matrix $B$**: $B[i][j] = 1.0$ for all $i, j$
- **Mathematical Operation**: $C[i][j] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} A[i][k] \times B[k][j]$
- **Expected Verification Value**:
  $$C[0][0] = \sum_{k=0}^{3999} (1.0 \times 1.0) = 4000.00$$

## 7. Technical Analysis & Discussion

1. **Sequential CPU Baseline**: Serves as the computational baseline ($244.12\text{s}$). Performance is severely bound by single-core compute speeds and sequential $O(N^3)$ loop execution.
2. **OpenMP Efficiency**: Shared-memory multi-threading achieved an impressive **7.92× speedup** on 8 CPU threads ($\sim 99\%$ parallel efficiency). Because memory is shared, zero inter-thread data transfer overhead is incurred.
3. **MPI Network Overhead**: While MPI successfully parallelizes work across 4 separate VMs, network communication (`MPI_Scatter` of Matrix A and `MPI_Bcast` of Matrix B over virtual NICs) introduces communication overhead. Thus, speedup is $2.63\times$ compared to OpenMP's $7.92\times$.
4. **CUDA GPU Dominance**: CUDA achieves an extraordinary **1,479.48× speedup**. Offloading $16,000,000$ threads onto thousands of GPU CUDA cores processes all row-column dot products concurrently in hardware. The kernel execution itself completes in just **0.146 seconds**.

## 8. Conclusion & Engineering Takeaways

1. **Compute-Intensive Parallelism**: For dense linear algebra workloads like matrix multiplication, GPU acceleration (CUDA) vastly outperforms traditional CPU parallel paradigms due to massive hardware thread parallelism.
2. **Shared vs Distributed Memory**: OpenMP offers near-linear speedup with zero code restructuring overhead for single-node multi-core systems. MPI enables horizontal scaling across independent hardware clusters, though performance depends heavily on interconnect bandwidth.
3. **Deterministic Verification**: All four parallel paradigms produced identical verification outputs ($C[0][0] = 4000.00$), confirming numerical correctness across all computing models.
